  I am a Linux kernel developer with 14 years of experience across different subsystem.  
  At present I am working on vertical storage stack integration, mainly in NVMe driver, block layer, io-uring.  
  In the past,I have written a vNIC driver. I worked for Samsung Mobile Battery Management drivers including battery drivers and fuelgauge driver. Very long back I have written Audio codec drivers in Linux ALSA layer.  
  Some of the patches which I got integrated in Linux kernel can be found [here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-block.git/log/?qt=author&q=nj.shetty)
