I am Nitesh Shetty, a Linux kernel developer working on storage stack.  
At present I am working on NVMe, block layer, io-uring.  
In the past, I wrote a vNIC driver based and commercialization of Samsung  
mobile battery management system including charging driver and fuelgauge IC  
Long long back I wrote a ALSA audio codec driver.  
My patches which are in mainline kernel are [here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-block.git/log/?qt=author&q=nj.shetty)
